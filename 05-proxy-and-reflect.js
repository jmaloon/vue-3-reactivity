// Notice our get has an additional parameter called receiver which weâ€™re
// sending as an argument into `Reflect.get`. This ensures that the proper value
// of `this` is used when our object has inherited values / functions from
// another object. This is why we always use `Reflect` inside of a `Proxy`, so
// we can keep the original behavior we are customizing.
